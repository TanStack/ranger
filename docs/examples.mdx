# Examples

- [**Simple**](./examples/simple) - All of these examples use automatic state management, meaning, they don't hoist any state out of the table or manually control anything. Start here for understanding the basics about how to build your table UI.

- [**Complex**](./examples/complex) - These examples are more advanced because they demonstrate how to manually control and respond to the state of the table.

- [**Controlled**](./examples/controlled) - These examples are more advanced because they demonstrate how to manually control and respond to the state of the table.

- [**UI & Rendering**](./examples/ui) - These examples demonstrate how to use React Table with your favorite UI libraries or tools!
