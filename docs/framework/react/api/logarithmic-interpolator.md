The API below described how to use the **logarithmic-interpolator** features.

## Options

By default, `react-ranger` uses linear interpolation between data points, but allows you to easily customize it to use your own interpolation functions by passing an object that implements the following interface.

### interpolator

```tsx
interpolator: {
    getPercentageForValue: (val: number, min: number, max: number): number;
    getValueForClientX: (clientX: number, trackDims: object, min: number, max: number): number;
}
```
The Interpolator to use. Defaults to the bundled linear-scale interpolator
 - `getPercentageForValue` - Takes the value & range and returns a percentage [0, 100] where the value sits from left to right.
 - `getValueForClientX`- Takes the clientX (offset from the left edge of the ranger) along with the dimensions and range settings and transforms a pixel coordinate back into a value.
