## Visit [/docs](https://github.com/tanstack/react-table/tree/alpha/docs) for docs, guides, API and more!

## Quick Features

- ~14kb or less (with tree-shaking)
- 100% TypeScript (but not required)
- Headless (100% customizable, Bring-your-own-UI)
- Auto out of the box, opt-in controllable state
- Filters (column and global)
- Sorting (multi-column, multi-directional)
- Grouping & Aggregation
- Pivoting (coming soon!)
- Row Selection
- Row Expansion
- Column Visibility/Ordering/Pinning/Resizing
- Table Splitting
- Animatable
- Virtualizable
- Server-side/external data model support

## Notable Changes

- Full rewrite to TypeScript
- Removal of plugin system to favor more inversion of control
- Vastly larger and improved API
- Better controlled state management
- Better support for server-side operations
- Agnostic Core (+ other framework adapters!)

## Migration

Currently migration will involve rewrites to:

- Any table logic and API surrounding the `useTable` hook
- Any custom plugins must be rewritten to wrap/compose the new `useTable` hook
- Table markup API must be rewritten to use the new API. Don't worry, this is not as big of a deal as it sounds :)

# or
yarn add @tanstack/react-table@alpha
```

## How to help?

- Try out the already-migrated examples
- Try it out in your own projects.
- Introspect the types! Even without the docs finished, the library ships with 100% typescript to help you explore its capabilities.
- [Read the contribution guidelines](https://github.com/tanstack/react-table/tree/alpha/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Write some docs! Start with the [API docs](https://github.com/tanstack/react-table/tree/alpha/docs/docs/api-reference) and try adding some information about one or more of the features. The types do a decent job of showing what's supported and the capabilities of the library.
- Try your hand at migrating an example to v8! The todo list for the examples is above!
- **Using a plugin?** Try rewriting your plugin (v8 doesn't have a plugin system any more) as a wrapping hook/function that uses `useTable` internally. The new API is much more powerful and easier to compose. If you find something you can't figure out, let us know and we'll add it to the API.
